# rokomari_price_analysis
This was a job hiring assignment given my rokomari.com. The data was small, obviously a generated one for test purpose. I tried to describe myself while diving deep as much as possible.


This includes:
- Data Extraction
- Data Cleaning
  - Handling Missing Values
  - Handling Duplicate Values
  - Cleaning Dtypes
- Exporting Cleaned Data
- Feature Extraction
- Price Monitoring Analysis

Upon the analysis, key findings were discussed in the *Key Insights* Section.
